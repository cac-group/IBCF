                          IBCF (InterBlockChain-Fund)
Intro:
   BANG! The Cosmos' first index fund ends and a void beckons adventurers. The call to index crypto, Cosmos, culture... 
$IBCX failed, subjectively it was a technicality but objectively the execution of a index fell short in it's mission.
The failure of $IBCX was due to a bad software update, this is a risk to non-custodial DeFi. Hard forks are required
to intervene in the case of $IBCX in order to alter the blockchain state. Let's get out of the weeds and back to the 
point, that Cosmos wants an index tool; enter $CAC (Cosmos Airdrop Chat) and $IBCF (IBC-Fund).
$IBCF is born of the desire for $IBCX to succeed. Early Cosmonauts and IONians remember the novelty $IBCX promised,
and the excitement of a roadmap vision being delivered. The mission of $IBCF is largely unchanged, in fact it grew.
$IBCF mechanics and architecture will be explained later, more context & bullshit will be tamped such that the fund
memetically & technically attracts capital. The second Cosmos index fund will be drastically different than the first.
 he aim of $IBCF is to not rug people. Simply put the biggest failure of $IBCX was rugging people. Many ecosystems show
capital will bag hold until literally no end, there seemingly needs to be an end for capital to meaningfully exit. Lol,
Yes you basically just have to not steal or cheat or lie to your clients and your business in crypto can accel. $CAC knows
this secret, and can deliver it wholesomely without a promise because we are after all only human.

Background of $CAC:
   Cosmos Airdrop Chat is the homebase of Cosmos. The decentralized nature of Cosmos has led to a highly PvP environment at
all levels, retail, developer, investor... Community naturally began to form through the shared drive of profiteering & fun.
$CAC is a memecoin entirely unrelated to the origin of Airdrops & also $ION or $IBCX, it's relationship to $IBCF will also be
less than $ION's to the origin fund. The disassociation of DAO to product is a realization through the years that the best
products tend to be ones centrally managed. The community ethos does not align with centralization, this Achilles heel is
necessary for $IBCF to begin because scaling & decentralization can be acheived later after better product market fit. So for
$IBCF to truly succeed it will mean it becomes a community managed & owned initative. $CAC similar to $ION offers no monetary
advantage and is purely memetic. $IBCF may or may not fully relate to $CAC and this is purposefully open ended because it is 
not necessary for the initial stages of the fund nor impede future stages. The relationship of $CAC to $IBCF is in Apollo-One.
The original test launch as well as the operator of IBCF, Apollo-One is a cat and does not know what he's doing.
This is all a bunch of nonsense to say that $CAC isn't going anywhere, and that we're a bunch of autist degens who love crypto
passionately. Who better to navigate the seven seas with than a bunch of unruly pirates who live for glory and die with honor?
$CAC, the hunter gatherers of airdrops who divided labor until they evolved into an advanced DAO where only the strongest survive.
$IBCF's origin in grassroots Cosmonauts extends to it's purpose, to not rug people; everything is built around this focus.

Product:
   $IBCF will be target date managed trades. The original fund ($IBCF) tracks Apollo-One which is an unrestricted active trading book.
Some example funds and their trophes follow:
*IBCA (Airdrops)
*IBCD (Defi)
*IBCE (Entertainment)
*IBCF (First)
*IBCG (Gaming)
*IBCI (AI/DePin)
*IBCM (Memes)
*IBCL (Liquid)
*IBCS (Stables)
Fund shares will be mintable in 100$ lots, with 3 month expiries and do not consider unstaking times unique to each fund. 

Fees:
   Fees are sent to the $CAC treasury. A 0.02% creation fee which 50% (0.01%) Creation fee is not reapplied if funds are extended
past expiry. There is an active management fee of 0.02% APY, this fee is applied weekly (~0.000385%). Creation epochs will be a
scam 9-5, and epochs will open & close on Sundays 10pm UTC. The experimental model of $IBCF is not profit driven but purpose 
driven. The purpose is to index crypto without rugging. Still, it would be unnatural to claim we're not profit oreintated, a 
0.06% profit sharing fee will also be collected (funds expiring above mint value pay 0.06% of profits). Thanks for playing.

This jargon is necessary to make it crystal clear what always has been the case, this is not a game this is the real world, trust me bro.
