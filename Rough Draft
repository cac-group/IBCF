                          IBCF (InterBlockChain-Fund)
Intro:
   BANG! The Cosmos' first index fund ends and a void beckons adventurers. The call to index crypto, Cosmos, culture... 
$IBCX failed, subjectively it was a technicality but objectively the execution of a index fell short in it's mission.
The failure of $IBCX was due to a bad software update, this is a risk to non-custodial DeFi. Hard forks are required
to intervene in the case of $IBCX in order to alter the blockchain state. Let's get out of the weeds and back to the 
point, that Cosmos wants an index tool; enter $CAC (Cosmos Airdrop Chat) and $IBCF (IBC-Fund).
$IBCF is born of the desire for $IBCX to succeed. Early Cosmonauts and IONians remember the novelty $IBCX promised,
and the excitement of a roadmap vision being delivered. The mission of $IBCF is largely unchanged, in fact it grew.
$IBCF mechanics and architecture will be explained later, more context & bullshit will be tamped such that the fund
memetically & technically attracts capital. The second Cosmos index fund will be drastically different than the first.
 The aim of $IBCF is to not rug people. Simply put the biggest failure of $IBCX was rugging people. Many ecosystems show
capital will bag hold until literally no end, there seemingly needs to be an end for capital to meaningfully exit. Lol,
Yes you basically just have to not steal or cheat or lie to your clients and your business in crypto can accel. $CAC knows
this secret, and can deliver it wholesomely without a promise because we are after all only human.

Background of $CAC:
   Cosmos Airdrop Chat is the homebase of Cosmos. The decentralized nature of Cosmos has led to a highly PvP environment at
all levels, retail, developer, investor... Community naturally began to form through the shared drive of profiteering & fun.
$CAC is a memecoin entirely unrelated to the origin of Airdrops & also $ION or $IBCX, it's relationship to $IBCF will also be
less than $ION's to the origin fund. The disassociation of DAO to product is a realization through the years that the best
products tend to be ones centrally managed. The community ethos does not align with centralization, this Achilles heel is
necessary for $IBCF to begin because scaling & decentralization can be acheived later after better product market fit. So for
$IBCF to truly succeed it will mean it becomes a community managed & owned initative. $CAC similar to $ION offers no monetary
advantage and is purely memetic. $IBCF may or may not fully relate to $CAC and this is purposefully open ended because it is 
not necessary for the initial stages of the fund nor impede future stages. The relationship of $CAC to $IBCF is in Apollo-One.
The original test launch as well as the operator of IBCF, Apollo-One is a cat and does not know what he's doing.
This is all a bunch of nonsense to say that $CAC isn't going anywhere, and that we're a bunch of autist degens who love crypto
passionately. Who better to navigate the seven seas with than a bunch of unruly pirates who live for glory and die with honor?
$CAC, the hunter gatherers of airdrops who divided labor until they evolved into an advanced DAO where only the strongest survive.
$IBCF's origin in grassroots Cosmonauts extends to it's purpose, to not rug people; everything is built around this focus.

Benefit of IBC-Fund
  Crypto is a fast moving market. Intense volatility is an active manager's playground, but smart contracts & software can't move as 
lightning fast as the market can. In order to "find alpha" you need to be able to mimic the natural market. $IBCF was too rigid, and
governance burdened to effectively find alpha, on top of which it's software bricking actually offset all gains with prinicpal marks.
$IBCF changes the model entirely by putting the minter first and the manager second, no governance theatre, no promise of riches;
only a commitment to market exploration & freedom. Ditching the smart contracts $IBCF aims to showcase that delegation can be privately
arranged, and successfully executed. Discretion is the key principle of $IBCF, the pragmatic realization that a cat with Keplr wallet
can do a lot of heavy lifting. Cosmos needs more discretion.
  $IBCF aims to be a low fee, public orientated product. Coming of the people for the people it's best scenario is limit principal 
losses to price movements and avoid rugs entirely. With limited liabilities and no infrastructure the operations learn from $ION DAO
and other publicly funded goods to charter a benevolent ship with good mates & lasses. Scalability & decentralization are the 
trade-offs sacrificed in this trilemma. Small scale microcosm is where innovation can be most likely, this kernel leads $IBCF to
embody as many niches as the community can think of / demand reasonably. The benefit of passive optionality is entirely unexplored in
Cosmos and IBC-Fund may deploy long/short strategies or long-only, each fund can be specific & non-fungible enabling hyper-optionality.

Product:
   $IBCF will be target date managed trades with non-fungible deliverables. Accounts will be basis by basis. The original fund $IBCF 
tracks Apollo-One which is an unrestricted active trading book. Other funds' objectives will be detailed in a prospectus soon^tm.
Some example funds and their trophes follow:
*IBCA (Airdrops)
*IBCD (Defi)
*IBCE (Entertainment)
*IBCF (First Fund)
*IBCG (Gaming)
*IBCI (AI/DePin)
*IBCM (Memes)
*IBCL (Liquid)
*IBCS (Stables)
Fund shares will be mintable in 100$ lots, with 3 month expiries and do not consider unstaking times unique to each fund.
Convertibility of funds is not planned neither at launch nor in a future product. $IBCF is a custodial 

Fees:
   Fees are sent to the $CAC treasury. A 0.02% creation fee which 50% (0.01%) Creation fee is not reapplied if funds are extended
past expiry. There is an active management fee of 0.02% APY, this fee is applied weekly (~0.000385%). Creation epochs will be a
scam 9-5, and epochs will open & close on Sundays 10pm UTC. The experimental model of $IBCF is not profit driven but purpose 
driven. The purpose is to index crypto without rugging. Still, it would be unnatural to claim we're not profit oreintated, a 
0.06% profit sharing fee will also be collected (funds expiring above mint value pay 0.06% of profits). Thanks for playing.
    Fee Summary - 0.20% maximum
*    0.02% Creation Fee 
      0.02% APY AUM Fee
       0.06% Profit Fee
** 0.10% Early Exit Fee

Operations:
Funds will be managed with evolving targets & projections, with each trophe attempting to provide exposure to a niche market.
Accounts will be created on a per basis frequency, and only with approved parties. Wishfully, NFTs back each fund share someday.
Approved parties are recognized onchain verification combined with social coordination during the 9-5 for creation and 
redemptions. Fund creation begins on chain and ends on chain, self-custody is still necessary for $IBCF and loss of keys can 
disrupt redemptions. Approved parties via signing must confirm primary withdraw address and secondary, prior to minting. 

Disclosure:
These are experiment products and all funds risk total principal loss. The operator is a cat and the minter releases all liability.
This jargon is necessary to make it crystal clear what always has been the case, this is not a game this is the real world, trust me bro.
